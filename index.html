        I'm a Colorado native.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lived in New Mexico for a brief time and then hustled back to my home in Colorado.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy the many outdoor sports, mainly camping and exposing myself to the elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fancy roller skating and dabbled in roller derby, but gave it up because I feel like I've abused my body enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm married and have a beautiful daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a menagerie of cats (five total) and two rambunctious dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write code and enjoy expanding my knowledge of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a Quality Assurance Analyst, it was cool and it piqued my curiousity with using techology to automate tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've recently completed a full stack web development bootcamp at University of Denver...
      </p>
      <p>
        and now I'm seeking out my next exciting challenge.
      </p>
